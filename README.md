# F1 Live Car Tracking

F1 in 2020 introduced a very interesting feature in their race transmitions, a computer vision feature that shows the car in the front with some infomations toguether.
It can be seen in this [video at 2:40](https://youtu.be/abFGhepdBWw?t=150). This work tries to implement something like that, but using only template matching methods.
It was used the OpenCV 2 Python library.
